# Verisure Process Mapping Project

This repository contains the business analysis, process mapping, and improvement recommendations delivered for the **Verisure Insurance Claims Improvement Initiative**. The project focuses on enhancing efficiency and customer satisfaction by transforming the existing manual claims process into a streamlined, semi-automated workflow.



## 📌 Project Overview

Verisure, a leading North American insurance provider, experienced an increase in customer complaints related to delays, lack of visibility, and inconsistent communication during claims processing.

This project analyzes the **current (“As-Is”)** process, identifies root-cause inefficiencies, and delivers a **future-state (“To-Be”)** process that integrates automation, improved customer touchpoints, and clearer workflow handoffs.



## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Reduce claim processing delays  
- Improve transparency for customers  
- Minimize manual handling and handoff errors  
- Implement automated claim triage and verification  
- Increase customer satisfaction and process trust

✔ Bottleneck & Root-Cause Analysis  
✔ Business Requirements  
✔ AI/Automation Opportunities
